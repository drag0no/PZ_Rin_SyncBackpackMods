Revamped and Updated version of: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2593268632] Eliaz Better Bags & Backpacks B41 [/url]

Built for version B41.78!  There are no plans to support B42...

SAFE TO ADD MID-GAME!

In case if you added this mod MID-GAME and have bags with old parameters, there are REFRESH recipes for fixing old bags.

This mod doesn't add any new items, it just changes some parameters of the vanilla's and mods' bags and backpacks to make them aligned.

Features:
- Sync Bags and Backpacks of the same type across multiple mods;
- Bigger capacity and weight reduction for many bags and backpacks;
- Speed penalty slightly reduced.

BONUS:
- Reworked Satchel: you can wear a satchel with a backpack!
