[u] Revamped and Updated version of: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2593268632] Eliaz Better Bags & Backpacks B41 [/url] [/u]

[b] Built for version B41.78! [/b][i] There are no plans to support B42... [/i]


[h2] IMPORTANT [/h2]

SAFE TO ADD/REMOVE MID-GAME!

In case if you added this mod MID-GAME and have bags with old parameters, there are REFRESH recipes for fixing parameter of old (pre-spawned) bags.


[h2] DESCRIPTION [/h2]

Hate seeing a Duffel Bag with capacity of 38? Like... How is it even possible?

This mod mainly made to address these issues, aligning and slightly buffing parameters of the backpacks across all popular mods.

It doesn't add any new items, it just changes some parameters of existing bags and backpacks.

Features:
- Sync Bags and Backpacks of the same type across multiple mods;
- Bigger capacity and weight reduction for many bags and backpacks;
- Speed penalty slightly reduced.

BONUS:
- Reworked Satchel: you can wear a satchel with a backpack!
